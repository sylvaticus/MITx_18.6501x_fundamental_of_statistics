# Recitation 03: Confidence Intervals of the shift of shifted exponential random variables

$X: pdf(x) = e^{-x-a}\mathbf{1}_{x \geq a}$

(0 whenever x is less than a and the value of this function when x equal or greater than a)

where $a \in R$ is an unknown parameter.

Objectives:
- Find an estimator $\hat a$ for the unknown shift parameter $a$
- Determine the (asymptotic) distribution of $\hat a$
- Compute confidence intervals for $a$ based on $\hat a$
- Compare results with a different estimator of the same parameter $a$

In this recitation problem, we'll
be computing a confidence interval for model
in two different ways.
We'll actually be computing two different confidence intervals.

Exponential with parameter 1, but shifter at the right of (unknown) a

Shifted exponential distribution

Robustness of the estimator: if there are some outliers
No, we did not. What robustness for an estimator means in non-technical terms is that the estimator should not react wildly to a few outliers.
