Introduction to Generalized Linear Models; Exponential Families

At the end of this lecture, you will be able to

- Recognize the two components, namely the noise distribution and the regression function , being generalized from linear models to form the generalized linear models .
- Define appropriate link functions for a generalized linear model.
- Define k-parameter exponential families of distributions.
- Define canonical exponential families of distributions.
- Compute the mean and variance of canonical exponential families in term of the log-partition function b

### 21.05. Predator-Prey Example: Poisson Link Function
So there will be two different things.
One is the modeling where I actually
decide what I want mu to look like, and then
try to work with a g that makes my life easy-- to have
a linear model in the end.
Or some places where I don't really
want to do some modeling, and I'm
going to pick some canonical choices for this.
