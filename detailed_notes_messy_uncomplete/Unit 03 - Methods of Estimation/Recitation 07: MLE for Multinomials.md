## Recitation 07: MLE for Multinomials

### 1. Maximum Likelihood Estimator for Multinomial

Recitation problem statement

Consider a finite space E={a1,a2,…,ar}
of size r≥2 and let X be a random variable taking values in E. For j=1,…,r, let p∗j=P[X=aj]. Consider a sample of n i.i.d. copies X1,…,Xn of X. Based on this sample, we would like to estimate the multivariate parameter p∗=(p∗1,…,p∗r)

- What is the parameter space ?

- Write the likelihood associated with the model described above.

- Compute the maximum likelihood estimator p^ of p∗

- Using the central limit theorem, show that p^ is asymptotically normal. Compute the asymptotic covariance matrix. Denote it by Σ

- Prove that Σ is not invertible. Conclude that the theorem for the MLE could not have been applied here. What condition is not satisfied ?
